# MinChat
MinChat is a Mindustry mod that adds an innovative global online chat feature.

This mod allows players to communicate with each other in real time
regardless of where they are or to which server they're connected tp,
enabling them to connect with other mindustry players outside of Discord.

We __do not__ and __will not__ connect any confidentional or analytical
data, other than what's required to authenticate you.

# Structure
Tne server provides a list of channels users can talk in. Each channel has
a name and a description.

Each registered user can send messages in any channel they have access to.
Once sent, the message is visible to anyone. The author of a message can
edit or delete it.

Before a user can start communicating in MinChat, they need to create an account,
i.e. register in MinChat. This is done by creating a unique username and a password.
Later, the user will be able to log into their account with their credentials.
A registered user can change their username or delete their account.
